# Reproduce goal prompt

Before using this draft, read [`../references/runtime.md`](../references/runtime.md) from the committed pack.

> Source material for a reviewable host run draft. Do not start a run, create an event binding, send a message, or write a tracker or pull request until the user explicitly authorizes the exact target and the host exposes the needed capability.

Read and follow `.agents/automations/benny/skills/reproduce-and-fix-issues/SKILL.md` for this run.

Configuration source. Include this repository-relative path only when it is committed in the same target repository. Otherwise paraphrase the configured values. Never use a plugin source or cache path:

```text
{{BENNY_CONFIG_PATH}}
```

Trigger:

```json
{
	"source_channel_id": "{{SLACK_CHANNEL_ID}}",
	"message_ts": "{{SLACK_MESSAGE_TS}}",
	"thread_ts": "{{SLACK_THREAD_TS_OR_EMPTY}}"
}
```

The creation intent should describe this as a new top-level report in the configured source Slack channel. It should include the configured repository, default branch, issue tracker, control adapter, feature map, and draft pull request capability.

If there is no concrete report event, explicitly started manual single run, or native goal established for this report, keep this as a draft and stop. Do not poll, invent a webhook, or claim that the run is listening.

Treat the source channel and root thread timestamp as immutable. If either is missing or does not match configuration, stop without posting.

Wait for a configured triage marker from the configured triage identity in this exact thread. Proceed only for `[benny:bug]` or `[benny:performance]`.

Require the configured control-adapter skill before attempting a repro. Reproduce the exact discriminating symptom twice through the real UI. Verify existing pull requests or commits without authoring over them. Attempt a bounded fix only after a confirmed repro and the operational file's fix gate.

The coordinator is the only Slack poster. Every child prompt must forbid `SendSlackMessage`, `PostToSlack`, `chat.postMessage`, and all other Slack writes. Children return findings only.

Never post a root message in the source channel.
